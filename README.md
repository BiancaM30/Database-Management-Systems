# Database-Management-Systems

This repository contains 4 projects for the Database Management Systems course. Each lab covers different aspects of database management and manipulation, from SQL queries to implementing concurrency control scenarios in .NET.

## Lab 1: Database Design
- **Objective:** Design a database with appropriate tables, constraints, and relationships.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Implementing foreign keys, primary keys, and constraints.
  - Designing complex relationships between tables.
  
## Lab 2: Master-Detail Form using ADO.NET
- **Objective:** Create a master-detail form to manage data in a 1-n relationship using ADO.NET.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Configuration-driven form generation.
  - Managing data with data sets, data adapters, and data readers.
  - XML configuration for form layout and database queries.
  
## Lab 3: Database Modification
- **Objective:** Modify the database designed in Lab 1 using stored procedures and triggers.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Implementing stored procedures and triggers for data manipulation.
  - Handling database transactions and ensuring data consistency.
  
## Lab 4: Concurrency Control
- **Objective:** Implement scenarios involving dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, phantom reads, and deadlock.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Simulating concurrency issues in a database.
  - Creating stored procedures for managing concurrent transactions.
  - Implementing a .NET application with multithreading to reproduce deadlock situations and retry mechanisms.
